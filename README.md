## About
Kriegbot is a bot licensed under the MIT license. Originally written for Discord, this bot is now being targetted to also work with Slack.

Discord functionality is a bit broken and incompatible with slack's dealio.

## Special Notes

I will be uploading existing code to be licensed under the MIT License here. If you notice anything that you would like to improve, you are free to branch off of mainline and open up a PR. You can also abide by the MIT License and not have to do that, its up to you.
