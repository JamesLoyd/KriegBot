# TODO 

- Setup GRPC
- Handle Events for when PR's are raised and when reviews happen
- Inform users via slack DM that a PR is ready for review based on role
- Inform select users if a PR is ready for a demo
- Break modules up so they can be in thier own repos if necessary, current modules are too specific to my needs versus a more general approach. This should be fine for early development though.
